//        Purpose
//        As a programmer it is important to understand the state of the programme at any given time.
//        When you work with variables, you should, therefore,
//        be able to state what is inside your variable after declaration and initialization.
//
//        Code example
//        Consider the following piece of code:
        
        // Position 1
        short x, y;
        // Position 2
        x = 1234;
        // Position 3
        y = 99;
        // Position 4
        short z = x;
        // Position 5
        y = x;
        // Position 6


//        Exercise
//        State what the values for the variables x, y and z are at each position during execution of the code.
//        You can use the table below. If you are unsure, use the println() method to print the variable.
